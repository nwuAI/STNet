* **SAIL (Statistic Analysis And Intelligent Learning) Lab of NWU**

* We provide related codes and configuration files to reproduce the "STNet: Structure and Texture-guided Network for image inpainting"

## Introduction
Our paper proposes a novel deep learning model STNet to restore the damaged images, which can be considered as a combination of the extension of image decomposition and the inverse process of it.
